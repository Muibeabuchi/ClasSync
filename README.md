# 🎓 ClassSync — Smart Attendance for Smart Classrooms

ClassSync is a modern, scalable web app designed to digitize attendance for Nigerian universities and beyond. It allows lecturers to easily take attendance using GPS verification and code input, while students check in from their own devices — all powered by intuitive UI and secure backend architecture.

Built with ❤️ for HACK4FUTO, but structured for real-world scale.
