# üì£ ClassyNk Notifications Guide

This document outlines the behavior, purpose, and structure of the notifications system in the ClassyNk application. It is intended to guide implementation across the backend and frontend, ensuring consistent, predictable behavior.

---

## üîî Overview

Notifications in ClassyNk are designed to keep users (primarily students and lecturers) informed in real-time about key events and actions within the app. The system relies entirely on Convex‚Äôs real-time database capabilities to push updates to the frontend ‚Äî there is no polling, email, or web-push delivery at this stage.

Notifications are strictly **in-app**, persistent, and must be manually marked as read. They are **not dismissible**, **not temporary**, and **do not expire** automatically.

## üß© Notification Use Cases

The following events currently generate notifications:

### 1. Student Requests to Join Course

- **Recipient:** Lecturer
- **Description:** When a student requests to join a course using the course code, the lecturer is notified of the incoming request, with relevant details attached.
- **Purpose:** Prompt lecturer review and approval.

### 2. Student Request is Approved or Rejected

- **Recipient:** Student
- **Description:** Once a lecturer takes action on a student‚Äôs request (approval or rejection), the student receives a notification reflecting the outcome.
- **Purpose:** Inform student of their admission status to the course.

### 3. Attendance Session Starts

- **Recipient:** All approved students in the course
- **Description:** When a lecturer initiates a new attendance session, enrolled students receive a notification indicating the session has begun.
- **Purpose:** Alert students to take attendance during the designated session window.

### 4. Subscription or Plan Updates

- **Recipient:** Lecturer
- **Description:** When a lecturer‚Äôs subscription plan changes (e.g., upgraded, downgraded, expired), a notification is sent reflecting this change.

## üîÑ Notification Behavior and UI

### Visibility

- Users can view notifications via:
  - A **notification bell icon** in the top navigation bar
  - A **dedicated notifications page** listing all past alerts

### Unread Indicators

- Unread notifications are visually distinct.
- An unread count appears on the notification bell until all are marked as read.

### Read/Manage

- Users can:
  - Mark individual notifications as read
  - Mark all as read
- Notifications persist unless manually marked.

### Deep Linking

- Some notifications include internal links that direct users to a relevant area of the app (e.g., course page, approval request view, session page).
